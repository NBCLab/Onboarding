# Onboarding
Resources and activities for new NBC lab members. Inspired by the [Whitaker lab's](https://github.com/WhitakerLab) great [Onboarding](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding) repo.

## First steps
1. [Sign up](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) for a GitHub account and join the [NBCLab organization](https://github.com/NBCLab) by asking [Taylor](mailto:tsalo006@fiu.edu) to send you an invite.
    - We use GitHub to organize and share code related to our papers and ongoing projects.
    - You can sign up for a free account. By default, this does not come with private personal repositories, but you can either host private repositories under the NBCLab organization or [request an education discount](https://help.github.com/articles/applying-for-an-academic-research-discount/). They generally respond within a day or so.
    - Set your [organization visibility](https://github.com/orgs/NBCLab/people) to public (it's private by default). We want people to see that you're a member of the lab.
2. Join the [NBC lab](https://neuroinformaticslab.slack.com) and [FIU neuroscience](https://fiuneuro.slack.com) Slack teams by asking [Taylor](mailto:tsalo006@fiu.edu) to send you an invite.
    - We use the NBC lab Slack team to share news and posts related to the lab. The general channel is also synced with the lab's Google Calendar, so it posts reminders for lab meetings and the like.
    - The FIU neuroscience Slack team is great for inter-lab communication and for organizing journal clubs or other activities. The cognitive neuroscience grad student colloquium is also organized on this Slack team.
    - There is also a great [BrainHack](https://brainhack-slack-invite.herokuapp.com) Slack team with over 1500 members that anyone can join. That team has a lot of channels associated with interesting projects or interests.
3. Make sure that you are up-to-date on your [CITI](https://about.citiprogram.org/en/homepage/) certification in order to work on our projects. For our lab, this means completing the "Biomedical Human Research Course". Once you've completed the course (or if you already have and your certification has not expired), save your certification to a file and send the file to XXXX.
4. Talk to XXXX about being added to IRBs for projects you'll work on.

## For graduate students
1. Make sure to forward your employee email (e.g., `tsalo@fiu.edu`) to your student email (e.g., `tsalo006@fiu.edu`), or vice versa. Important emails may be sent to either or both, so it is very helpful to just forward one to the other.
2. Ask [Taylor](mailto:tsalo006@fiu.edu) to give you access to the NBC lab [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B543K-QXbp21WERUMkc5SVhjODg).
3. Ask XXXX to give you access to the NBC lab Dropbox folder.
4. Follow instructions [here](http://ircc.fiu.edu/accounts/) to obtain access to the FIU High Performance Cluster (HPC). We perform most of our data analysis on the HPC.
5. MRI safety training! [Diamela](mailto:darencib@FIU.EDU) coordinates and sends out emails that announce regular safety training opportunities.
6. Send [Taylor](mailto:tsalo006@fiu.edu) a blurb, photo, and any relevant links for the [lab website](https://nbclab.github.io). You can see examples by navigating to lab members' personal pages from the [Team](https://nbclab.github.io/team/) page.
    - Ultimately, we would like you to contribute changes to the website (e.g., news or blog posts, updates to your profile) more directly, by forking the [lab website's GitHub repository](https://github.com/NBCLab/NBCLab.github.io), making changes to your fork, and opening pull requests back to the main repository. However, for new lab members, this is not necessary.

## For university employees (e.g., RAs, post-docs, and faculty)
1. Ask [Taylor](mailto:tsalo006@fiu.edu) to give you access to the NBC lab [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B543K-QXbp21WERUMkc5SVhjODg).
