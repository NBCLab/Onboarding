# Onboarding
Resources and activities for new NBC Lab members. Inspired by the [Whitaker lab's](https://github.com/WhitakerLab) great [Onboarding](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding) repo.

## Resource Access and Communication
1. Ask [Dr. Laird](mailto:alaird@fiu.edu) to give you access to the NBC Lab and FIU Neuroscience Google calendars. 
2. Send a request to [Laura](mailto:lucros@fiu.edu) for keycard access to the lab (AHC4 380) as well as the east wing, which will allow you to swipe into the double doors by the elevator leading to our other offices. 
3. Ask [Taylor](mailto:tsalo006@fiu.edu) to give you access to the NBC Lab [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B543K-QXbp21WERUMkc5SVhjODg). This is a private folder accessible only by lab members. 
4. Ask [Dr. Laird](mailto:alaird@fiu.edu) to give you access to the NBC Lab Dropbox folder. This is also a private folder accessible only by lab members. 
5. Ask [Taylor](mailto:tsalo006@fiu.edu) to give you access to the NBC Lab's [Public Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B543K-QXbp21cTV0RjNoNUtMWnM?usp=sharing). This is a public folder that contains papers and presentations suitable for sharing outside the lab.  
6. [Sign up](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) for a GitHub account and join the [NBCLab](https://github.com/NBCLab) and [FIU-Neuro](https://github.com/FIU-Neuro) organizations by asking [Taylor](mailto:tsalo006@fiu.edu) to send you an invite.
    - We use GitHub to organize and share code related to our papers and ongoing projects. The NBC Lab organization is used for all lab-related projects, while the FIU-Neuro organization is used for tools that serve the whole program. 
    - You can sign up for a free account. By default, this does not come with private personal repositories, but you can either host private repositories under the NBCLab organization or [request an education discount](https://help.github.com/articles/applying-for-an-academic-research-discount/). They generally respond within a day or so.
    - Set your [NBCLab organization visibility](https://github.com/orgs/NBCLab/people) to public (it's private by default). We want people to see that you're a member of the lab. For the FIU-Neuro organization, it's your choice.
7. Join the [NBC Lab](https://neuroinformaticslab.slack.com) and [FIU Neuroscience](https://fiuneuro.slack.com) Slack teams by asking [Taylor](mailto:tsalo006@fiu.edu) to send you an invite.
    - We use the NBC Lab Slack workspace to share news and posts related to the lab. After you've joined, click on "Channels" and browse the list to see the available discussions, which are separate by lab project. The general channel is synced with the lab's Google Calendar, so it posts reminders for lab and project meetings. Add yourself to any and all of the lab's channels so that you can stay up to date on all of our recent progress. 
    - The FIU Neuroscience Slack workspace is great for inter-lab communication and for organizing journal clubs or other activities. The cognitive neuroscience grad student colloquium is also organized on this Slack workspace.
    - There is also a great [BrainHack](https://mattermost.brainhack.org) Mattermost workspace with over 1500 members that anyone can join. That space has a lot of channels associated with interesting projects or initiatives. Mattermost is an open source Slack alternative. To join the BrainHack workspace, use [this invite link](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/signup_user_complete/?id=orpd9qqjb7gqpnwg5k1fdagrqa).
    - Also use links available in each Slack space to join the associated Trello boards. We use [Trello](https://trello.com) for project management. 
8. Follow instructions [here](http://ircc.fiu.edu/accounts/) to obtain access to the FIU High Performance Cluster (HPC). We perform most of our data analysis on the HPC. [Michael](mailto:miriedel@fiu.edu) is your point of contact for the lab's access and use of the HPC.
9. Follow instructions [here](https://castic.fiu.edu/main/app/core/helpguides/Papercut-Mac.pdf) to obtain access to the printer queue. This will allow you to send your print jobs to a queue and release the jobs on the Toshiba printers in AHC-4 using your Panther ID card.

## Regulatory Compliance and Training
1. Every member of our lab that will be involved in any part of our research must complete some online courses through a program called CITI. The courses provide historical information of the use of human subjects in research as well as guidelines for keeping information gathered from participants confidential and protected. These courses should be completed prior to your start in the lab. Here are the instructions for creating an account and accessing these courses:
    - Go to [CITI](https://www.citiprogram.org) 
    - On the left side of the page select the "Register" option located under the heading "Create an account".
    - Enter "Florida International University" as your affiliated institution and click "Continue".
    - Enter your personal information and click "Continue".
    - Enter your preferred account information and click "Continue".
    - Enter demographic information and click "Continue".
    - Here it asks if you are "interested in the option of receiving Continuing Education Unit (CEU) credit for completed CITI Program courses?" select "No" and click "Continue".
    - In the section that asks for the "Institutional email address", enter your FIU email address. In the section that asks for your "Role in Research", select "Research Assistant". Towards the bottom, for the section that asks for the "Office phone" write 305-348-0464, and when it asks "Which course do you plan to take?" select "Basic Human Subjects - Social & Behavioral Focus". Click "Continue".
    - When it asks "Do you conduct research in any of the following settings?" select "Human Subjects Research" and "Health Information Privacy and Security (HIPS)". When it asks "Do you conduct or supervise studies that use human subjects?" select "Social & Behavioral Human Research Investigators Course". When it says "If you want to take Health Information Privacy and Security (HIPS), please make your selection below", select "Health Information Privacy and Security (HIPS) Course - Information for Investigators"
    - To finish creating your account click "Finalize Registration". Now you will be able to access the courses.
    - When you complete the courses you will get a certificate of completion. Please send the pdf file of your course completion certificate to [Laura](mailto:lucros@fiu.edu). send me an e-mail with a PDF of each course certificate.
    - If you are a graduate student, postdoc, or new faculty member you also need to complete the ["Responsible Conduct in Research"](http://research.fiu.edu/rcr/training/) course. This completion certificate should also be sent to [Laura](mailto:lucros@fiu.edu).
2. Our projects are reviewed by [FIU's Institutional Review Board (IRB)](http://research.fiu.edu/irb/) to ensure the protection of human subjects in research. Talk to both [Chelsea](mailto:cgreaves@fiu.edu) and [Laura](mailto:lucros@fiu.edu) about being added to IRB-approved protocols for projects you'll work on. You must complete this before working with any research participant or analyzing any data.
3. MRI safety training! [Diamela](mailto:darencib@fiu.edu) coordinates and sends out emails that announce regular safety training opportunities. Email her to RSVP for the [next session](http://cismri.fiu.edu/training-sessions/). 

## Recommended Reading
1. The NBC Lab's [Public Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B543K-QXbp21cTV0RjNoNUtMWnM?usp=sharing) contains a folder called "recommended-reading". A list of recommended textbooks, journal articles, and youtube videos are provided, organized by topic. Topics range from an introduction to MRI data acquisition and analysis to recent papers published by lab members to papers related to newly launched projects. 

## Graduate Students
1. Make sure to forward your employee email (e.g., `tsalo@fiu.edu`) to your student email (e.g., `tsalo006@fiu.edu`), or vice versa. Important emails may be sent to either or both, so it is very helpful to just forward one to the other.

## The NBC Lab Website
1. Send [Taylor](mailto:tsalo006@fiu.edu) a blurb, photo, and any relevant links for the [lab website](https://nbclab.github.io). You can see examples by navigating to lab members' personal pages from the [Team](https://nbclab.github.io/team/) page.
2. Ultimately, we would like you to contribute changes to the website (e.g., news or blog posts, updates to your profile) more directly, by forking the [lab website's GitHub repository](https://github.com/NBCLab/NBCLab.github.io), making changes to your fork, and opening pull requests back to the main repository. However, for new lab members, this is not necessary.
    
## Undergraduate Research Assistants
1. Please read the recommended reading (above).
2. Talk to the undergraduate research assistant coordinator to find out about the projects that are looking for assistance.
3. Once you know the project that you would like to work on, set up a meeting with the graduate student involved to know more about the project.
