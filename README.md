# Onboarding
Resources and activities for new NBC Lab members. Inspired by the [Whitaker lab's](https://github.com/WhitakerLab) great [Onboarding](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding) repo.

## Resource Access and Communication
1. Ask [Dr. Laird](mailto:alaird@fiu.edu) to give you access to the NBC Lab and FIU Neuroscience Google calendars. 
2. Send a request to [Laura](mailto:lucros@fiu.edu) for keycard access to the lab (AHC4 380) as well as the east wing, which will allow you to swipe into the double doors by the elevator leading to our other offices. 
3. Ask [Taylor](mailto:tsalo006@fiu.edu) to give you access to the NBC Lab [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B543K-QXbp21WERUMkc5SVhjODg). This is a private folder accessible only by lab members. 
4. Ask [Dr. Laird](mailto:alaird@fiu.edu) to give you access to the NBC Lab Dropbox folder. This is also a private folder accessible only by lab members. 
5. Ask [Taylor](mailto:tsalo006@fiu.edu) to give you access to the NBC Lab's [Public Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B543K-QXbp21cTV0RjNoNUtMWnM?usp=sharing). This is a public folder that contains papers and presentations suitable for sharing outside the lab.  
6. [Sign up](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) for a GitHub account and join the [NBCLab](https://github.com/NBCLab) and [FIU-Neuro](https://github.com/FIU-Neuro) organizations by asking [Taylor](mailto:tsalo006@fiu.edu) to send you an invite.
    - We use GitHub to organize and share code related to our papers and ongoing projects. The NBCLab organization is used for all lab-related projects, while the FIU-Neuro organization is used for tools that serve the whole program. 
    - You can sign up for a free account. By default, this does not come with private personal repositories, but you can either host private repositories under the NBCLab organization or [request an education discount](https://help.github.com/articles/applying-for-an-academic-research-discount/). They generally respond within a day or so.
    - Set your [NBCLab organization visibility](https://github.com/orgs/NBCLab/people) to public (it's private by default). We want people to see that you're a member of the lab. For the FIU-Neuro organization, it's you choice.
7. Join the [NBC Lab](https://neuroinformaticslab.slack.com) and [FIU Neuroscience](https://fiuneuro.slack.com) Slack teams by asking [Taylor](mailto:tsalo006@fiu.edu) to send you an invite.
    - We use the NBC Lab Slack workspace to share news and posts related to the lab. The general channel is synced with the lab's Google Calendar, so it posts reminders for lab and project meetings. There are also individual channels for our ongoing projects... feel free to browse these based on your interests.
    - The FIU Neuroscience Slack workspace is great for inter-lab communication and for organizing journal clubs or other activities. The cognitive neuroscience grad student colloquium is also organized on this Slack workspace.
    - There is also a great [BrainHack](https://brainhack-slack-invite.herokuapp.com) Slack workspace with over 1500 members that anyone can join. That space has a lot of channels associated with interesting projects or initiatives.
    - Also use links available in each Slack space to join the associated Trello boards. We use [Trello](https://trello.com) for project management. 
8. Follow instructions [here](http://ircc.fiu.edu/accounts/) to obtain access to the FIU High Performance Cluster (HPC). We perform most of our data analysis on the HPC. [Michael](mailto:miriedel@fiu.edu) is your point of contact for the lab's access and use of the HPC. 

## Regulatory Compliance and Training
1. Make sure that you are up-to-date on your [CITI](https://about.citiprogram.org/en/homepage/) certification in order to work on our projects. For our lab, this means completing the "Biomedical Human Research Course". Once you've completed the course (or if you already have and your certification has not expired), save your certification to a file and send the file to [Laura](mailto:lucros@fiu.edu).
    - If you are a graduate student, postdoc, or new faculty member you also need to complete the ["Responsible Conduct in Research"](http://research.fiu.edu/rcr/training/) course. This completion certificate should also be sent to [Laura](mailto:lucros@fiu.edu).
2. Our projects are reviewed by [FIU's Institutional Review Board (IRB)](http://research.fiu.edu/irb/) to ensure the protection of human subjects in research. Talk to both [Chelsea](mailto:cgreaves@fiu.edu) and [Laura](mailto:lucros@fiu.edu) about being added to IRB-approved protocols for projects you'll work on. You must complete this before working with any research participant or analyzing any data.
3. MRI safety training! [Diamela](mailto:darencib@fiu.edu) coordinates and sends out emails that announce regular safety training opportunities. Email her to RSVP for the [next session](http://cismri.fiu.edu/training-sessions/). 

## Recommended Reading
1. The NBC Lab's [Public Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B543K-QXbp21cTV0RjNoNUtMWnM?usp=sharing) contains a folder called "recommended-reading". A list of recommended textbooks, journal articles, and youtube videos are provided, organized by topic. Topics range from an introduction to MRI data acquisition and analysis to recent papers published by lab members to papers related to newly launched projects. 

## Graduate Students
1. Make sure to forward your employee email (e.g., `tsalo@fiu.edu`) to your student email (e.g., `tsalo006@fiu.edu`), or vice versa. Important emails may be sent to either or both, so it is very helpful to just forward one to the other.

## Other Science Community Resources
1. Sign up for the following science-related services:
    - [ORCID](https://orcid.org)
    - [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com)
    - [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io)
    
## The NBC Lab Website
1. Send [Taylor](mailto:tsalo006@fiu.edu) a blurb, photo, and any relevant links for the [lab website](https://nbclab.github.io). You can see examples by navigating to lab members' personal pages from the [Team](https://nbclab.github.io/team/) page.
2. Ultimately, we would like you to contribute changes to the website (e.g., news or blog posts, updates to your profile) more directly, by forking the [lab website's GitHub repository](https://github.com/NBCLab/NBCLab.github.io), making changes to your fork, and opening pull requests back to the main repository. However, for new lab members, this is not necessary.
    
## Undergraduate Research Assistants
1. Please read the recommended reading (above).
2. Talk to the undergraduate research assistant coordinator to find out about the projects that are looking for assistance.
3. Once you know the project that you would like to work on, set up a meeting with the graduate student involved to know more about the project.
