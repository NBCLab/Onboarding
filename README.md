# NBC Lab Onboarding
Resources and activities for new NBC Lab members. Inspired by the [Whitaker lab's](https://github.com/WhitakerLab) great [Onboarding](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding) repository.

# Graduate Student Onboarding
If you are a new graduate student with the NBC Lab, please complete the following steps:
 
## Getting Started
1. Read the [NBC Lab Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12QHTfVnjxmVAk9pki2hhspnFJB7QeDR3scstHV8KE_c/edit).
2. Trainees should complete the [NBC Lab Individual Development Plan for Predoctoral and Postdoctoral Scholars](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ekRK--hkTqg_tBnRisoIZs_IVUrljK2tNyACyXpl8WY/edit?usp=sharing). Please create your own version of this file for editing: click on File → Make a copy and save to your Google Drive; share with others by clicking the blue Share link on the top right.

## Resource Access and Communication
1. Ask [Dr. Laird](mailto:alaird@fiu.edu) to give you access to the NBC Lab Outlook calendar. 
2. Ask [Dr. Laird](mailto:alaird@fiu.edu) to give you access to the NBC Lab [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B543K-QXbp21WERUMkc5SVhjODg). This is a private folder accessible only by lab members. All research results (e.g., figures, tables) and associated documentation (e.g., manuscripts, conference abstracts) should be saved to the appropriate project sub-folder so that they are accessible to everyone. This helps us avoid gdoc-related permissions issues. 
3. Join the [NBC Lab](https://neuroinformaticslab.slack.com) and [FIU Neuroscience](https://fiuneuro.slack.com) Slack teams by asking [Dr. Laird](mailto:alaird@fiu.edu) to send you an invite.
    - We use the NBC Lab Slack workspace to share news and posts related to the lab. After you've joined, click on "Channels" and browse the list to see the available discussions, which are separated by lab project. Add yourself to any and all of the lab's channels so that you can stay up to date on all of our recent progress and discussions. 
    - The FIU Neuroscience Slack workspace is great for inter-lab communication and for organizing journal clubs or other activities. The cognitive neuroscience grad student colloquium is also organized on this Slack workspace.
    - Please edit your profile in both workspaces to include your full name in your Display Name, not just your first name or username, as well as a photo.	Add a helpful description of your role under “What I Do”, e.g., “Postdoctoral Fellow with Dr. Laird”, “Graduate Student with Dr. Sutherland”, “Research Assistant for ABCD”. We’d like this field to tell us about your educational level and who/which projects you’re working with/on.
4. [Sign up](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) for a GitHub account and join the [NBCLab](https://github.com/NBCLab) and [FIU-Neuro](https://github.com/FIU-Neuro) organizations by asking [Julio Peraza](mailto:jperaza@fiu.edu) to send you an invite.
    - We use GitHub to organize and share code related to our papers and ongoing projects. The NBC Lab organization is used for all lab-related projects, while the FIU-Neuro organization is used for tools that serve the whole program. 
    - You can sign up for a free account. By default, this does not come with private personal repositories, but you can either host private repositories under the NBCLab organization or [request an education discount](https://help.github.com/articles/applying-for-an-academic-research-discount/). They generally respond within a day or so.
    - Set your [NBCLab organization visibility](https://github.com/orgs/NBCLab/people) to public (it's private by default). We want people to see that you're a member of the lab. For the FIU-Neuro organization, it's your choice.
    -  Similar to your Slack profile, please edit your GitHub profile to include your full name in your Display Name, not just your first name or username, as well as a photo and a helpful description of your role (i.e., your educational level and your membership in the NBC Lab).<!-- 5. Ask [Dr. Laird](mailto:alaird@fiu.edu) to send you an invite to the NBC Lab's Trello workspace. We use [Trello](https://trello.com) for project management. --> 
5. Follow instructions [here](http://ircc.fiu.edu/accounts/) to obtain access to the FIU High Performance Cluster (HPC). We perform most of our data analysis on the HPC. [Julio Peraza](mailto:jperaza@fiu.edu) is your point of contact for the lab's access and use of the HPC.
6. We recommend that you use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) to help you collect, organize, cite, and share research. Download the application and browser plugin, then send your Zotero username to [Dr. Laird](mailto:alaird@fiu.edu) and she will add you to the NBC Lab Zotero group.
7. (Optional) There is also a great [BrainHack](https://mattermost.brainhack.org) Mattermost workspace with over 1500 members that anyone can join. That space has a lot of channels associated with interesting projects or initiatives. Mattermost is an open source Slack alternative. To join the BrainHack workspace, use [this invite link](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/signup_user_complete/?id=orpd9qqjb7gqpnwg5k1fdagrqa).

Towards the bottom, for the section that asks for the "Office phone" write 305-348-0464, and when it asks "Which course do you plan to take?" select "Basic Human Subjects - Social & Behavioral Focus". Click "Continue".
    - When it asks "Do you conduct research in any of the following settings?" select "Human Subjects Research" and "Health Information Privacy and Security (HIPS)". When it asks "Do you conduct or supervise studies that use human subjects?" select "Social & Behavioral Human Research Investigators Course". When it says "If you want to take Health Information Privacy and Security (HIPS), please make your selection below", select "Health Information Privacy and Security (HIPS) Course - Information for Investigators"
    - To finish creating your account click "Finalize Registration". Now you will be able to access the courses.
    - When you complete the courses you will get a certificate of completion. Please place a copy of the pdf certificate in the Google Drive under irb-resources --> citi-certs.
    - If you are a graduate student, postdoc, or new faculty member you also need to complete the ["Responsible Conduct in Research"](http://research.fiu.edu/rcr/training/) course. This completion certificate should be uploaded to our Google Drive: *nbclab --> irb-resources --> citi-certs*. Please create a folder with your last name as the folder name and upload your CITI certificate there.
2. Our projects are reviewed by [FIU's Institutional Review Board (IRB)](http://research.fiu.edu/irb/) to ensure the protection of human subjects in research. Please talk to [Dr. Laird](mailto:alaird@fiu.edu) and confirm that you have been added to the IRB-approved protocols for the project(s) you'll work on. You must complete this before working with any research participant or analyzing any data.
3. Learn more about the [FIU IRB Topaz Online Protocol Submissions](https://research.fiu.edu/irb/topaz/), including information on [Accessing the System](https://research.fiu.edu/irb/topaz/#accessingsystem). Submit a [Topaz Protocol Access Request Form](https://webforms.fiu.edu/view.php?id=2099084) so that you will show up in the system and can be added to our IRB protocols. 

## MRI Safety Training
Every member of our lab should complete MRI safety training so that you will be allowed to access the MRI facilities at FIU's [Center for Imaging Science](https://cismri.fiu.edu). Please click on [this link](https://fiu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bkjyKMM2tDJwcxT) to begin this training. You will be provided an opportunity to watch two videos (the Siemens MRI safety video and the CIS MRI safety presentation) and complete the 25-question safety exam. To pass, you must complete the exam with an 80%. If you have any questions, please contact [Lita Sabates](mailto:lisabate@fiu.edu) .

## Physical and In-Person Access
1. Send a request to [Lita Sabates](mailto:lisabate@fiu.edu) for keycard access to the lab (AHC4 380) as well as the east wing, which will allow you to swipe into the double doors by the elevator leading to our other offices.
2. Follow instructions [here](https://castic.fiu.edu/main/app/core/helpguides/Papercut-Mac.pdf) to obtain access to the printer queue. This will allow you to send your print jobs to a queue and release the jobs on the Toshiba printers in AHC-4 using your Panther ID card.

## Recommended Reading
The NBC Lab's [Public Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B543K-QXbp21cTV0RjNoNUtMWnM?usp=sharing) contains a folder called "recommended-reading". A list of recommended textbooks, journal articles, and youtube videos are provided, organized by topic. Topics range from an introduction to MRI data acquisition and analysis to recent papers published by lab members to papers related to newly launched projects. 

## Graduate Student Emails
Grad students have two email addresses- a student email (which has numbers, like `tsalo006@fiu.edu`) and an employee email (which generally doesn't, like `tsalo@fiu.edu`). The student email is accessible on Gmail, while the employee email is accessed through Outlook. Make sure to forward your employee email to your student email, or vice versa. Important emails may be sent to either or both, so it is very helpful to just forward one to the other.

## Necessary Software
1. Python 3: A large portion of the code used in the lab is written in Python. Install Python on your laptop using the [Anaconda distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/#installation).
2. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com): Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a text editor you can use to write code. There are a number of add-on packages you can install to add helpful features.
3. A [VPN Client](https://network.fiu.edu/vpn/): You will need a VPN client like Cisco AnyConnect in order to access the HPC from home.
4. An SCP Client: You will need an SCP client like [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io) to transfer files to and from the HPC.
5. [git](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git): git is necessary for version control and is a key component of GitHub.
    - You can also download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), which provides a simplified GUI for using git.
6. [Follow these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) to set up git on the HPC.
